/* LESSON TEMPLATE: a block lesson (Concept · Intermediate · Formal), in page order.
   Copy into web/content/<field>/<id>.js and fill every field. The brief is docs/subjects/LAYERS.md; the finished
   reference page is web/content/arithmetic/counting.js. Not loaded by the app (docs/ is never built).

   Voice:  [5G] = Concept/Intermediate voice: 5th-grade reading level, adult tone, sentences under ~15 words, "you" + a verb,
                  no "just/simply/easy/obviously", no exclamation marks, praise, "Let's" or emoji.
           [COL] = Formal voice: college-level precision, standard terms (OpenStax Prealgebra 2e order).
   Markup: backtick strings are HTML; math in <span class="m">…</span>, lab colours with class c1–c5 (= the lab's keys);
           never `${` inside a backtick string. Plain "…" strings are escaped text (no tags).
   Lab:    chips {label, lab: "cmd:arg,cmd"} use ONLY commands your lab exposes; `echo` and goal `key`s use ONLY values it
           publishes (table in LAYERS.md → "Your lab"). Storyboards: LAYERS.md → "Storyboards".
   Checks: every number below that a learner reads or types goes in checks/<field>/<id>.py (LAYERS.md → "Checks"). */
